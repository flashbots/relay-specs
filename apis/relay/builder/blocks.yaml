  operationId: "submitBlock"
  summary: Submit a new block to the relay.
  description: |
    * Blocks can be submitted as JSON or SSZ, and optionally GZIP encoded. To be
      clear, there are four options: JSON, JSON+GZIP, SSZ, SSZ+GZIP. If JSON, the
      content type should be `application/json`. If SSZ, the content type should
      be `application/octet-stream`.
    
    * To enable GZIP compression for the request body, the HTTP content encoding 
      should be `gzip`. Compression is optional.
    
    * The relay will simulate the block to verify properties and proposer
      payment in the payment transaction from builder to proposer
      `fee_recipient` at the end of block.
    
    * For accountability, builder signature is over the SSZ encoded `message`.
    
    * The `message`, which does not include the transactions, will be made
      public via the data API, allowing anyone to verify the builder signature.
    
    * Any new submission by a builder will overwrite a previous one by the same
      `builder_pubkey`, even if it is less profitable.
